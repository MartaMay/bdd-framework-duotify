BBD Framework Building Steps:

1. Create a maven project
2. Add the necessary dependencies
3. Add 3 Cucumber specific dependencies: cucumber-java, cucumber-core, cucumber-junit
4. Add .gitignore
5. Create the package structure (runner, stepdefinitions, resources)
6. Add the necessary utilities and .property files
7. Add the feature file and scenarios
8. Add the step definition class
9. Generate the step definition snippets
10. Implement the code for each step definition
11. Run the scenario by tagging it with a tag
12.


In Cucumber framework:
  - the test scenarios are put in a feature file which are usually are created under resources folder
  - the feature file scenario steps are connected to step definitions through @CucumberOptions "glue" option in Runner class
  - Cucumber scenario step is matched to step definition method using the text of the scenario step either with Regular Expressions or Cucumber Expressions
  - tags is the primary way to control what scenario or feature files to run
  - Background -> the common steps for ALL scenarios of a feature file can be moved to Background steps
  - Hooks -> Step definition methods annotated with @Before and @After that are executed before/after each SCENARIO. The annotated methods can be added into any class under Step Definitions folder but usually added into a separate class called Hooks
